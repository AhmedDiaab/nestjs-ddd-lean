# Contributing

This repository exists to be forked. Most people arrive here right after clicking "Use this
template" or `git clone`-ing their fork, so this page starts there.

## Getting set up

```bash
nvm use          # or install the Node version in .nvmrc by hand (>= 22.18.0)
corepack enable   # or install pnpm 10.15.0 some other way
pnpm install      # also installs the git hooks — see "How the rules are enforced" below
```

If this is a new project starting from the template (not a contribution back to the template
itself), rename it before writing any code:

```bash
pnpm rename-project <kebab-name> ["Title"]
```

That updates `package.json`, the `APP_NAME` used in problem URNs, the Swagger title and the
Windows service name in one pass — see the script's own output for exactly what it touched.

Then copy `.env.example` to `.env.development`, set at least `NODE_ENV=development` and
`JWT_SECRET` (32+ characters), and `pnpm start:dev`.

## The gate

`pnpm verify` is the done check. Run it before saying anything is finished:

```bash
pnpm verify
```

It chains `typecheck`, `lint`, `lint:test`, `check:circular`, `test`, `test:e2e` and `build`. This
template has no CI (`.github/workflows`) by design — see [`docs/known-gaps.md`](docs/known-gaps.md)
— so running `pnpm verify` yourself, plus the two things it does not include,
`pnpm format:check` and `pnpm test:cov`, is what stands in for a pull-request check today. Wire
your own pipeline's equivalent if you need one on the fork.

`test:cov` fails if coverage drops below the floor in `jest.config.ts`:

| Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- | ----- |
| 82%        | 68%      | 68%       | 83%   |

That floor is a floor, not a target — raise it when coverage genuinely rises (new tests landing
faster than new code), but never lower it to make a change pass. If a change would drop coverage
below it, add the missing tests instead.

## Commit messages

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`type(scope):
subject`), enforced by [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) on every commit via a `commit-msg`
hook — see `commitlint.config.mjs`. In short:

- `type` is one of `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`,
  `style`, `test`.
- `subject` doesn't start with a capital letter (no sentence-case). Embedded acronyms are fine
  (`feat(logging): log the error's origin frame instead of a stack trace...` is a real commit in
  this repo's history and passes).
- The body, when there is one, explains **why**, not just what changed — especially for fixes.
- `scope` is not a closed list: this repo invents a scope per feature or area rather than
  maintaining an enum. Recent examples, straight out of `git log --oneline`: `cluster`,
  `scheduler`, `config`, `logging`. Pick whatever names the area you touched; commitlint won't
  reject a new one.

Merge commits (`Merge branch '...'`) are exempt automatically — commitlint ignores them by
default, so merging a feature branch never trips the hook.

## How the rules are enforced

Most of this repository's conventions are enforced by tooling, not by review discipline alone:

- **Layer boundaries** (`interface → application → domain`, infrastructure behind ports):
  `eslint.config.mjs`'s `no-restricted-imports` rules per layer, `madge` for import cycles
  (`pnpm check:circular`), and the layer specs under `test/unit/layers/` that assert the rule
  itself hasn't been weakened.
- **One thing per file** and **named barrel exports** (no `export *`): ESLint (`max-classes-per-file`,
  a custom `no-restricted-syntax` rule for `ExportAllDeclaration`).
- **Formatting**: Prettier, checked with `pnpm format:check` and applied to staged files locally
  by `lint-staged` on every commit (see below), so a formatting diff never has to be caught later
  in review.

The rules themselves, and why they're shaped this way, are documented in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) rather than restated here — read
those for the actual conventions (database access, error handling, testing, ports/tokens, etc.).

### Git hooks

`pnpm install` runs `prepare`, which installs [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) hooks
into `.husky/`:

- **`pre-commit`** runs `lint-staged` — ESLint (`--fix`) then Prettier on staged `*.ts` files,
  Prettier alone on staged `*.md`/`*.json`/`*.yml`/`*.yaml`. It only touches what you staged, so a
  commit stays fast; the full gate (`pnpm verify`, `pnpm test:cov`) still runs by hand and is
  still the thing that has to pass before merging.
- **`commit-msg`** runs commitlint against the message you just wrote.

`git commit --no-verify` skips both hooks. It exists for emergencies (a hotfix, a hook that's
itself broken) — reach for it deliberately, not as a way around a message the hook is right to
reject.

## Release process

There is no release bot, deliberately. Cutting a version is a manual, three-step process:

1. Every pull request that changes behaviour, configuration or conventions adds its entry under
   `## [Unreleased]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), in the same commit as the change — see the
   file's own header for the section skeleton (`Added` / `Changed` / `Deprecated` / `Removed` /
   `Fixed` / `Security`).
2. When it's time to cut a release, fold `## [Unreleased]` into a new `## [X.Y.Z]` section (date
   included), tag `vX.Y.Z`, and push the tag.
3. Create a GitHub release from that tag, with the folded changelog section as its notes.

## Decision records

Non-obvious architectural or process calls get a short record under `docs/decisions/` (template
and index: [`docs/decisions/README.md`](docs/decisions/README.md)). Read the relevant one before
changing what it covers, and add a new record rather than silently reversing one.

Decision numbers are shared with this template's fuller sibling, `nestjs-ddd`: a record numbered
`000N` here and `000N` there is the same decision, adapted to what each repository actually has —
see [decision 0015](docs/decisions/0015-shared-files-between-the-two-templates.md) for the full
rule, the list of files worth diffing between the two repos when either one changes, and which
decision numbers are gaps in this template's sequence on purpose (a subsystem this leaner template
doesn't have).

This change (repository hygiene: license, contributing guide, PR template, commit linting and git
hooks) has no decision record of its own — this file is the record for it, mirroring how the full
template documented the same change.
