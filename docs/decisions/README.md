# Decisions

Short records of choices that shape the codebase. Read the relevant one before changing what it covers; add a new record instead of silently reversing one.

[`nestjs-ddd`](https://github.com/AhmedDiaab/nestjs-ddd), that don't apply here — see
[decision 0015](0015-shared-files-between-the-two-templates.md).
