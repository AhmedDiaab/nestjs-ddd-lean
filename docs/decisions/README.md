# Decisions

Short records of choices that shape the codebase. Read the relevant one before changing what it covers; add a new record instead of silently reversing one.

| #                                                              | Decision                                                                              | Status   |

The gap in the sequence (0014) is a decision from the full template,
[`nestjs-ddd`](https://github.com/AhmedDiaab/nestjs-ddd), that doesn't apply here — see
[decision 0015](0015-shared-files-between-the-two-templates.md).
