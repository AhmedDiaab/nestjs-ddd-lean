# Operations

## Build and run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build                          # → dist/
NODE_ENV=production node dist/main  # or: pnpm start:prod with NODE_ENV set in the environment
```

- Requires Node.js ≥ 22.18.
- The working directory must contain the `.env.<NODE_ENV>` file; environment variables override file values.
- Non-TypeScript runtime files (templates, SQL files) must be listed in `nest-cli.json` → `compilerOptions.assets` or they won't be copied to `dist`.

| Script             | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm start:dev`   | watch mode, `NODE_ENV=development`            |
| `pnpm start:debug` | watch + inspector                             |
| `pnpm start:repl`  | Nest REPL with history (`.nest_repl_history`) |
| `pnpm start:prod`  | `node dist/main` (no forced `NODE_ENV`)       |

## Health endpoints

For uptime monitors, load balancers and orchestrators. No auth, not rate limited, version neutral, successful polls not logged.

| Endpoint            | 200 when                                                                                                           | Failure                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /health`       | the process accepts HTTP                                                                                           | no response                                                                                            |
| `GET /health/ready` | every implemented DB source answers a ping within `DATABASE_PING_TIMEOUT_MS`, and the process is not shutting down | **503** with per-source `details` (error text hidden in production), or `SHUTTING_DOWN` while draining |

Monitoring tools should check the **status code**. Pick the endpoint by what "down" means for you:

- "API process down": `/health`
- "API down or its database unreachable": `/health/ready`

A load balancer pool member should be checked with `/health/ready`, so a draining instance is taken out before it stops listening. A container **liveness** probe should use `/health`, so a brief database blip — or a shutdown in progress — doesn't get the process restarted.

Response (`/health/ready`):

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "status": "ok",
        "sources": [
            {
                "sourceKey": "main",
                "dialect": "oracle",
                "implemented": true,
                "ok": true,
                "latencyMs": 4,
                "pool": { "connectionsOpen": 2, "connectionsInUse": 0, "poolMin": 2, "poolMax": 10 }
            }
        ]
    },
    "meta": { "timestamp": "...", "path": "/health/ready", "requestId": "..." }
}
```

## Startup failures

| Symptom                                                 | Cause                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `❌ Invalid configuration:` + paths, exit 1             | env missing/invalid (values not printed)                  |
| `AggregateDbHealthError` at boot                        | a required DB source failed its pings                     |
| `DatabaseConnectionError ... Failed to acquire` at boot | pool creation failed (credentials, network, service name) |

## TLS

**Default: terminate TLS in front of the app** — a load balancer, VIP, ingress or reverse proxy — and let the app speak plain HTTP behind it. This is what [Migrate a legacy service](../guides/migrate-a-legacy-service.md) assumes, and it stays the right choice whenever such a terminator exists: certificate rotation, ALPN/HTTP2 negotiation and TLS version policy all become the terminator's job instead of this app's.

Set `TLS_ENABLED=true` only when no terminator sits in front of this process — chiefly the [Windows service](#windows-service-nssm) install, which drops `node dist/main.js` straight onto a host with nothing in front of it by default. With it on, `main.ts` reads `TLS_KEY_FILE`/`TLS_CERT_FILE` (and optionally `TLS_CA_FILE`, `TLS_PASSPHRASE`, `TLS_MIN_VERSION`) once at bootstrap, before Nest starts, and passes them to `NestFactory.create` as `httpsOptions`; the server then listens for HTTPS directly, and the startup log line prints `https://` instead of `http://` so which mode is live is obvious at a glance. See [decision 0011](../decisions/0011-tls-optional-in-process.md).

`TLS_ENABLED` and `TRUST_PROXY` ([Configuration → HTTP](configuration.md#http)) answer two different questions and are normally opposites of each other:

| Variable      | Question it answers                                                  | Behind a load balancer | No terminator (e.g. Windows service) |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | Did an upstream already terminate TLS and forward `X-Forwarded-For`? | `true`                 | `false`                              |
| `TLS_ENABLED` | Does _this process_ need to terminate TLS itself?                    | `false`                | `true`                               |

File permissions: `TLS_KEY_FILE` must be readable only by the account the process runs as — the same account NSSM (or systemd) runs the service under. Treat it like any other secret: not group- or world-readable, never committed (`.gitignore` excludes `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`, `*.cer`, `*.pfx`, `*.p12`), rotated the way `JWT_SECRET` or a database password would be.

A bad path or an empty file fails at boot, not on the first HTTPS request — the same `❌ Invalid configuration:` line as any other invalid config ([Startup failures](#startup-failures)), naming the path and never the file's contents.

**HSTS is already on.** `helmet()` sends `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` on every response, with or without `TLS_ENABLED` — verified against the installed helmet rather than read from its docs. Over plain HTTP behind a terminator the header is simply ignored by browsers, which is why it has never mattered here. Once this process serves HTTPS itself, it binds: a browser that sees it will refuse plain HTTP to that host, **and to every subdomain**, for a year. Two consequences worth knowing before you enable TLS — test in a private window or on a throwaway hostname, because a browser pinned by a self-signed localhost experiment stays pinned; and if any subdomain must stay HTTP, override helmet's `hsts` option rather than discovering it in production.

### Manual verification

No e2e test generates a certificate in-process — that would need a dependency this template doesn't otherwise carry, just to exercise a Node built-in. Check it by hand instead, with a throwaway self-signed pair generated **outside the repo**:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 1 -subj "/CN=localhost"
TLS_ENABLED=true TLS_KEY_FILE=$(pwd)/key.pem TLS_CERT_FILE=$(pwd)/cert.pem pnpm start:dev
```

Then, from another terminal:

```bash
curl -k https://localhost:3000/health   # -k: self-signed cert, not in curl's trust store
```

A plain `curl http://localhost:3000/health` fails (connection reset) once TLS is enabled — there is no plain-HTTP listener alongside it. Delete the throwaway key/cert afterwards.

## Graceful shutdown

On `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) the process shuts down in the order a load balancer expects:

| Step | What happens                                                                                      | Why                                                                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | `/health/ready` starts answering **503 `SHUTTING_DOWN`**                                          | the load balancer stops routing here while the instance can still serve                    |
| 2    | it keeps serving for `SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_DELAY_MS` (default 5s)                                       | a monitor needs a poll or two to notice; closing the port first turns requests into errors |
| 3    | the server stops accepting connections; in-flight requests finish                                 | idle keep-alive sockets are closed so they don't hold the server open                      |
| 4    | after `SHUTDOWN_FORCE_AFTER_MS` (default 10s), remaining connections are cut                      | one stuck request must not keep the process alive forever                                  |
| 5    | `JobScheduler.stop()` waits up to `SHUTDOWN_JOB_DRAIN_MS` (default 10s) for an in-flight cron job | it still needs the database pools the next step closes                                     |
| 6    | the application closes: database pools drain with `drainTimeSec`                                  | pools outlive the requests and jobs using them                                             |

`GET /health` stays **200** the whole time: a liveness probe that fails during shutdown gets the process killed in the middle of the requests it is trying to finish.

Set the stop grace period of whatever runs the process (Kubernetes `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, Docker `--stop-timeout`, NSSM) **above** `SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_DELAY_MS + SHUTDOWN_FORCE_AFTER_MS + SHUTDOWN_JOB_DRAIN_MS + drainTimeSec`, or it will `SIGKILL` in the middle of the sequence.

Sizing the drain delay: it must exceed the load balancer's health-check interval × unhealthy threshold. A monitor polling every 5 seconds needing 2 failures needs more than 10 seconds, not the 5 second default.

This is deliberately **not** `app.enableShutdownHooks()`: Nest's own handler runs the destroy hooks — which close the database pools — before the HTTP server stops, so requests still in flight lose their connection.

## Scheduled jobs

Cron jobs live in `src/interface/scheduler` and run inside the API process, off unless `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true`, with cron expressions read in `SCHEDULER_TIMEZONE` (default UTC).

- **Every instance with the switch on runs every job.** With several separate instances (containers, VMs) behind a load balancer, run one instance with `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true` (the "worker") and leave it off on the others, or make the jobs safe to run more than once.
- The worker can stay in the pool (it still serves HTTP) or be taken out of it; either way its `/health` must answer for the monitor.
- Failures are logged as `scheduler.job.failed` and never stop the process; overlapping runs are skipped (`scheduler.job.skipped`). Alert on those two events.
- Startup logs one `scheduler.job.scheduled` per job with its next run; `scheduler.disabled` means the switch is off.
- On shutdown, `JobScheduler.stop()` stops new runs immediately and waits up to `SHUTDOWN_JOB_DRAIN_MS` (default 10s) for one already in flight. Past that it logs `scheduler.drain.timeout` and the process keeps closing, so jobs must still be safe to repeat.
- Writing one: [Add a scheduled job](../guides/add-a-scheduled-job.md).

## Windows service (NSSM)

`start-service.ps1` / `stop-service.ps1` at the repository root. Run as Administrator.

Prerequisites: [NSSM](https://nssm.cc) on PATH, Node.js ≥ 22.18, `pnpm install && pnpm build`, `.env.<environment>` in the app directory.

```powershell
.\start-service.ps1                                    # NestjsDddLeanApiService, NODE_ENV=production
.\start-service.ps1 -ServiceName MyApi -Environment staging -NodePath "E:\node\node.exe" -StopTimeoutMs 20000
.\stop-service.ps1 -ServiceName MyApi                  # stop, keep registered
.\stop-service.ps1 -ServiceName MyApi -Remove          # stop and unregister
```

Checked without Windows by `pnpm test:service-scripts` (Docker): both scripts parse, and they run in the PowerShell container against recorders for `nssm`, `node` and `Get-Service` (fresh install, reinstall, Node too old, missing build, failing NSSM call, stop, stop + remove, already stopped, missing service). Registering a real service is still verified on Windows.

What `start-service.ps1` does:

1. Checks nssm, node version, `dist\main.js`, and the env file (warns if missing).
2. Removes an existing service with the same name, then installs `node dist\main.js` with `AppDirectory` = the repo.
3. Sets **only** `NODE_ENV` on the service. dotenv-flow reads `.env.<env>` at startup, so secrets never land in the service registry.
4. Configures graceful stop (Ctrl+C, then wait `StopTimeoutMs`), restart on crash after 5 s, auto start.
5. Writes service stdout/stderr to `logs\service-stdout.log` / `service-stderr.log`, rotated at 10 MB. Application logs still go to `logs\app.log` via pino-roll.

Re-run `start-service.ps1` after changing its parameters. After changing only `.env.<env>` or `dist`, restarting the service is enough.
