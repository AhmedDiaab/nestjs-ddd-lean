## Reference

**Architecture**

- [Overview](architecture/overview.md): layers, dependency rules, folder map, request lifecycle
- [Diagrams](architecture/diagrams.md): request sequence, layers, database call
- [Dependency injection](architecture/dependency-injection.md): typed tokens, `ProviderFactory`, where ports live
- [Domain layer](architecture/domain-layer.md): entities, value objects, aggregates, domain errors
- [Application layer](architecture/application-layer.md): use cases, `Result`, ports, application errors
- [HTTP interface](architecture/http-interface.md): envelope, validation, errors → status, auth, guards, Swagger, security
- [Database](architecture/database.md): sources, pools, Oracle client, context user, transactions, errors, health
- [Configuration](architecture/configuration.md): env pipeline and every variable
- [Logging](architecture/logging.md)
- [Testing](architecture/testing.md)
- [Operations](architecture/operations.md): build, run, health endpoints, Windows service, shutdown

**[Glossary](glossary.md)**: the vocabulary (repository, DAO, query port, gateway, read model…) and which one to pick.

**Decisions** ([index](decisions/README.md)): why things are the way they are.

**[Known gaps and open items](known-gaps.md)**: a dated, honest review of what is missing or weak, and what to fix first.

**Guides** use one running example, a _Tickets_ feature (open, close, get, list). Its code was compiled and tested against this template; the full implementation is on the `example/tickets` branch.

## Conventions used in these docs

- Paths are relative to the repository root.
- `@domain`, `@application`, `@infrastructure`, `@interface`, `@common`, `@shared` are TypeScript path aliases for `src/<layer>`.
- "Port" = an interface a layer depends on; "adapter" = the infrastructure class that implements it.
