.SYNOPSIS
    Stops the API Windows service. Add -Remove to also unregister it.

.DESCRIPTION
    NSSM sends Ctrl+C first and waits AppStopMethodConsole ms (set by start-service.ps1),
    so Nest shutdown hooks can drain database pools before the process is killed.

.EXAMPLE
    .\stop-service.ps1
.EXAMPLE
    .\stop-service.ps1 -ServiceName MyApiService -Remove
#>
param(
    # Must match the name used with start-service.ps1
    [string]$ServiceName = "NestjsDddLeanApiService",

    # Also unregister the service (default: stop only, keep it registered)
    [switch]$Remove
)
